On compliant browsers (e.g., Chrome and Edge on desktop) you can transfer code directly from the coding environment over [Web USB](https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/web-usb/) making the develop-deploy experience incredibly easy - especially for kids.\\n\\n### Coding Languages\\n\\nThe most popular tutorials use block-based environments (MakeCode or Scratch) and we already know you can code with Python or Swift. But it turns out there are a number of [other programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Bit#Software) you can use - including C++, Rust, and BASIC.\\n\\n\\n### Unboxing micro:bit v2\\n\\nTo get started I got [this basic micro:bit v2 bundle](https://www.amazon.com/Vilros-BBC-Micro-Basic-Starter/dp/B08WR4X7P9/) from Amazon. Unboxed, you can see it contains the microcontroller board, a battery holder, a protective case, a USB2.0 cable - and some crocodile clips.\\n\\n![Microbit-v2](/img/microbit-unboxed.jpg)\\n\\nThis was sufficient to get us started with the basic [\\"Flashing Hearts\\"](https://makecode.microbit.org/) tutorial - and validate that the board was in fact working as advertised. `Bonus:` we used webUSB for all our downloads - and it was beautiful!!\\n\\nThat was it for today. Tomorrow, we do this all over again - this time with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/microbit) - so we can learn how to work with both these block-based coding environments before we move on to text editors and more features."},{"id":"hello-world","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/hello-world","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2022-01-23-hello-world.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-23-hello-world.md","title":"Hello World!","description":"Welcome to the AI From Scratch website and blog.","date":"2022-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 23, 2022","tags":[{"label":"general","permalink":"/blog/tags/general"}],"readingTime":0.3,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Nitya Narasimhan","title":"Pair-ent Programmer","url":"https://github.com/nitya","imageURL":"https://github.com/nitya.png","key":"nitya"},{"name":"A.J","title":"Middle Schooler","url":"https://github.com/ajcreates","imageURL":"https://github.com/ajcreates.png","key":"aj"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Micro:bit Machines!","permalink":"/blog/unbox-microbit"}},"content":"Welcome to the _AI From Scratch_ website and blog. \\n\\nThis a pair programming and collaborative learning project from me (Nitya, the parent) and my son (AJ, the middle-schooler) as we attempt to explore the fascinating world of machine learning and artificial intelligence in a youth-friendly way.\\n\\nWe\'re still setting things up so do come back later to see our progress."}]}')}}]);
